# ShakesToTheMoon

This project aims to allow budding developers get hands-on the concept of 3D-websites. It is a simple website I created during my initial days while learning Web Development. If you have basic understanding of coding, the code itself explains basic elements and how it can be edited to create a custom website.

For those who have no idea of codes, can change the image and content part in the code and deploy the website if they wish to!
